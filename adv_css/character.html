            <p>Then: Shauna is quiet but intelligent, often seen as the responsible one in the group. However, beneath her reserved demeanor lies a complicated web of secrets, including a betrayal that deeply affects her closest friendships—particularly with her best friend, Jackie. As the group fights to survive in the wilderness, Shauna is forced to confront her own moral limits, making choices that will haunt her forever.
                Now: As an adult, Shauna is a suburban mother living what seems to be an ordinary life, but under the surface, she harbors dark impulses and unresolved trauma. Trapped in a monotonous marriage and feeling disconnected from her past, she struggles with her own violent tendencies, hinting at the brutal survival instincts she developed as a teenager. Her need for control leads her to make reckless choices that threaten to unravel the life she has built.</p>

                <p>Then: Nat is the team’s rebellious outcast, known for her sharp wit, tough exterior, and deep-seated emotional wounds. Coming from a troubled home with an abusive father, she finds herself drawn to Travis, one of the only other survivors who understands her pain. In the wilderness, Nat proves to be one of the most skilled at hunting, a role that gives her a sense of purpose but also exposes her to the darker side of survival.
                    Now: As an adult, Nat struggles with substance abuse, using drugs and alcohol to suppress the trauma of her past. Though she tries to uncover the mysteries of what really happened in the wilderness, her self-destructive tendencies make it difficult for her to escape the cycle of pain. She is both fiercely independent and deeply lonely, constantly searching for meaning in the chaos of her life.</p>
