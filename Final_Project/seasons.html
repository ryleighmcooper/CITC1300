                    <p>Set in 1983, Season 1 begins with the mysterious disappearance of 12-year-old Will Byers. As his friends search for him, they encounter a girl with a shaved head and supernatural powers—known only as Eleven. Meanwhile, Will’s mother Joyce believes he’s communicating with her through lights, and Chief Hopper uncovers a conspiracy tied to Hawkins National Laboratory. The season ends with Will being rescued from the Upside Down, but he’s clearly not the same.</p>

                    <p>A year later, in 1984, the gang is trying to return to normal life—but Will continues to have visions of a giant, shadowy creature. As the threat of the Upside Down grows stronger, Eleven goes on a journey to learn about her past and meets others like her. The group battles a new breed of monsters called Demodogs and faces the Mind Flayer, a more dangerous entity from the Upside Down. In the end, Eleven closes the gate, but evil still lingers beneath the surface.</p>

                    <p>In Stranger Things Season 3, set during the summer of 1985, the kids of Hawkins navigate growing up, relationships, and the excitement of the new Starcourt Mall, which secretly houses a Russian lab attempting to reopen the gate to the Upside Down. Meanwhile, the Mind Flayer returns in a more terrifying form, possessing townspeople—including Billy—to build a monstrous new body. As strange events unfold, the group bands together once again to confront the supernatural threat, culminating in a battle beneath the mall that ends with Eleven losing her powers and Hopper seemingly sacrificing himself—though a post-credits scene hints he may still be alive.</p>
