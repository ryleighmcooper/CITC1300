    <h1>Yellowjackets</h1>
        <p>Yellowjackets is a thriller about a high school girls' soccer team whose plane 
            crashes in the wilderness, leaving them stranded. The series alternates between their 
            struggle for survival in the 1990s and their lives as adults, haunted by dark secrets from 
            their time in the wild. It explores themes of trauma, survival, and the psychological impact
             of their experiences.</p>

   <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>The Yellowjackets characters include Shauna Sadecki, often seen as the group's leader; Jackie Taylor, the 
        "Queen Bee"; Natalie "Nat" Scatorccio, whose rebellious nature and tough persona earn her the nickname "Nat"; 
        Misty Quigley, sometimes called "Misty the Freak" for her quirky ways; Tawny "Taissa" Turner, who is known for 
        her ambition and drive; and Lottie Matthews, who is often just referred to as "Lottie" and becomes a spiritual 
        figure in the group. As adults, Shauna remains the quiet leader, Natalie still goes by "Nat," Misty stays 
        eccentric, Taissa is focused on surviving at all costs, and Lottie retains her mysterious presence, 
        with each character haunted by the trauma of their past.</p>
